Schedule [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) goals by day of week. This project is abandoned
and bitrotted, I'm putting on GitHub in case anyone wants to fork it.

The frontend uses React and the backend lives on AWS Lambda and uses the Serverless framework. The
Node version used on the backend is very old and EOL on Lambda, so it needs to be updated. I don't
know how hard it'll be to get all the dependencies and tools running, my last commit was in May
2018 which is a hell of a long time ago in context.
